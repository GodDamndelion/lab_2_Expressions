## lab_2_Expressions

You can enter your expression in this form:
1. Enclose each action in parentheses, even division and multiplication too.
For example: (5-7)-(9+(16*42))
2. You need to enter a value for each parameter, even if they have the same.
For example: (15/(x+5)-12)*x 
                  |        |
                first and second
